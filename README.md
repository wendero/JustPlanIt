# JustPlanIt

JustPlanIt is a very simple and light Poker planning tool.

Coded in .Net Core and React it can be a proof of concept on how to easily integrate both technologies and also a startup pack for your own custom poker planning tool. =)

Please enjoy it!

## How to run it?

### Docker way of life

The first and easiest way JustRunIt is by using docker. 

*Running with scripts*

1) Clone the project
2) Run the build.sh script
3) Run the run.sh script

_There is no setup yet to use a build image and a runtime image, so the build is being done locally and the artifacts copied to the runtime image_

### .Net

1) Open /src directory
2) Run the command *dotnet run*

## How to run tests?

1) Open /tests directory
2) Run the command *dotnet test*
